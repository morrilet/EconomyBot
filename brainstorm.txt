Here's how a buy order might look:

TOMMY: $buy wood / 300@2 (#112) -> Buy order is created, money goes into escrow.
JOHN: $commit 112 100 -> Buyer is pinged and can approve the request.
TOMMY: (replying to JOHN's message) $approve -> Money for 100 wood is released from escrow and given to JOHN.
TOMMY: $cancel 112 -> The buy order is cancelled and the money remaining in escrow is returned to TOMMY.

Here's how a sell order might look:

TOMMY: $sell wood / 300@2 (#113) -> Sell order is created.
JOHN: $commit 113 30 -> Seller is pinged and can approve the request.
TOMMY: (replying to JOHN's message) $approve -> Money for 30 wood is given to JOHN.
SARAH: $commit 113 270 -> Seller is pinged and can approve the request.
TOMMY: (replying to SARAH's message) $approve -> Money for 270 wood is given to SARAH.
(Sell order is empty, and thusly closed.)
